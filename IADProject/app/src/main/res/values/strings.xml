    <string name="Intro1">               IAD which stands for insurance agent drone is a novel idea which can revolutionize the field of insurance and alleviate the problems in the current implemented methods. In the field of insurance human personals are used as insurance agents who attend personally to that certain specific place when a certain accident or a property damaged incurred. And they will carry out the analysis process of the damage incurred based on some predefined criteria. Then the agent personnel will fill out the motor vehicle inspection report. Another task of the personnel is to get a statement from the witnesses and take photographs of the damage incurred. So by using this project our target is to make this process autonomous by using the drone technology.</string>

    <string name="Intro2"> So our objective is to make this process autonomous by using a drone with ability to self guide to a particular location from a deployment station and carry out the review process of the damaged vehicle. And after analyzing, the gathered data will be fed into a system that would be capable of giving a report for the client and insurance agency.
</string>
    <string name="Benefits">•	The Accident location can be reached very fast the air travel distance is short and no traffic to oppose
•	Customer has the ability to notify the client of his exact location therefore finding him won’t be an issue
•	Client will be notified the exact location of the agent drone and the ETA
•	Can carry out the review process faster
•	Can take images and video clips
•	Generate a more accurate estimation
•	The review process will be carried out faster once the 3D model is taken.
